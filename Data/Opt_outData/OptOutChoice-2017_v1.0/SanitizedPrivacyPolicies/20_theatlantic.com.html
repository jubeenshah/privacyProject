Non-personally identifiable information does not individually identify you, but it may include tracking and usage information about your general location, demographics, use of the Sites and the Internet. Personally identifiable information is any information that can individually identify you and includes, your name, address, phone number, and email address, or non-personally identifiable information that has been linked to such personally identifiable information.<br><br>||| <strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br><br>As a general matter, you can browse the Sites without submitting your personally identifiable information to us.

Are his state's "hardworking taxpayers" any better off? <br><br>This past February, at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) outside Washington, D.C., Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker rolled up his sleeves, clipped on a lavalier microphone, and without the aid of a teleprompter gave the speech of his life. He emerged from that early GOP cattle call as a front-runner for his party's nomination for president. Numerous polls this spring placed him several points ahead of former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, the preferred candidate of the Republican establishment, in Iowa and New Hampshire. Those same polls showed him with an even more substantial lead over movement conservative favorites such as Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Mike Huckabee.

During the Polar Night, which lasts from November to January, the sun doesn't rise at all. Then the days get progressively longer until the Midnight Sun period, from May to July, when it never sets. After the midnight sun, the days get shorter and shorter again until the Polar Night, and the yearly cycle repeats.<br><br>So, perhaps understandably, many people had a hard time relating when I told them I was moving there. <br><br>||| "I could never live there," was the most common response I heard.

But as manufacturing shifted abroad after World War II, Youngstown steel suffered, and on that gray September afternoon in 1977, Youngstown Sheet and Tube announced the shuttering of its Campbell Works mill. Within five years, the city lost 50,000 jobs and $1.3 billion in manufacturing wages.

Ostensibly, the typical teacher in the United States works <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pss/tables/table_15.asp"> 180 or so days </a> annually, which comes with an average starting salary of a little over <a href="http://www.nea.org/home/2012-2013-average-starting-teacher-salary.html"> $36,000 </a> . But that excludes the work that he or she probably does throughout the summer, after school hours, and on the weekends.

He and McConnell, a librarian, had met at a Halloween party in Oklahoma in 1966, shortly after Baker was pushed out of the Air Force for his sexuality. From the beginning, the men were committed to one another. In 1967, Baker proposed that they move in together. McConnell replied that he wanted to get married-really, legally married. The idea struck even Baker as odd at first, but he promised to find a way and decided to go to law school to figure it out. <br><br><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/gay-marriage-supreme-court-politics-activism/397052/" > Continue Reading </a>     <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/396527/case-32-hour-workweek/"<br><br> ||| <strong>The Case for the 32-Hour Workweek</strong> <br><br>Ryan Carson, the CEO of Treehouse, discusses the benefits of a four-day workweek and why more companies can, and should, do it.<br><br><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/396527/case-32-hour-workweek/" > Watch Video </a>     <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/396218/its-quite-possible-to-live-without-a-smartphone/"<br><br> <strong>Living Simply With a Flip Phone</strong> <br><br>It's quite possible to live and date in New York without a smartphone.<br><br><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/396218/its-quite-possible-to-live-without-a-smartphone/" > Watch Video </a>     <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/396503/hipsters-battle-against-confederate-flaggers/"<br><br> ||| <strong>One Hipster's Battle Against the Confederate Flaggers</strong> <br><br>Every Saturday, Goad Gatsby loads up his tricycle and Kanye West tunes for a one-man protest against the Confederate flag. <br><br><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/396503/hipsters-battle-against-confederate-flaggers/" > Watch Video </a>    <br><br> <strong>Subscribe</strong> <br><br>Get 10 issues a year and save 65% off the cover price.<br><br><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/personal/archive/2013/10/fraud-alert-regarding-i-the-atlantic-i/280278/" >Fraud Alert regarding The Atlantic</a><br><br> <strong>Newsletters + </strong><br><br>     The Atlantic  <br><br>    The Atlantic  Daily     This Week     This Month  <br><br>   New Photo Galleries     Top Videos This Week  <br><br>   CityLab     Today's Top Stories     This Week's Most Popular Stories  <br><br>   I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors.  <br><br>   <strong>About + </strong><br><br>Copyright © 2015 by The Atlantic Monthly Group.
