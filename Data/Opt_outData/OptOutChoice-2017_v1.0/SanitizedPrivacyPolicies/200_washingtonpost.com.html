Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, the Services currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals. In the meantime, please see <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/privacy-policy/2011/11/18/gIQASIiaiN_story.html#U32130762296290eG">Online Tracking &amp; Advertising</a> for additional information about privacy choices that may be available to you with respect to targeted advertising.<br><br>||| <strong>International Transfers. </strong> The Services are headquartered in the United States.

Cookies may be used to store a unique identification number tied to your computer or device so that you can be recognized as the same user across one or more browsing sessions, and across one or more sites. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:<br><br>  Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you do not have to enter those credentials each time you visit a Service    Cookies can help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most popular because they help us see which pages and features visitors access and how much time they spend on the pages. By studying this kind of information, we are better able to adapt our Services and provide you with a better experience.   Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so that you don't receive the same ad each time you access a Service.  <br><br> Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but can be configured not to do so or to notify the user when a cookie is being sent. If you wish to disable cookies, refer to your browser help menu to learn how to disable cookies. If you disable browser cookies or flash cookies, it may interfere with the proper functioning of the Services.<br><br>||| <strong>Beacons.</strong> We, along with third parties, also may use technologies called beacons (or "pixels") that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device. We and third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of our Services and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.<br><br>||| <strong>Local Storage &amp; Other Tracking Technologies. </strong> We, along with third parties, may use other kinds of technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as "Flash cookies") and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Services. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings. For HTML5 local storage, the method for disabling HTML5 will vary depending on your browser. For Flash cookies, information about disabling or deleting information contained in Flash cookies can be found <a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html">here</a>.<br><br>||| <strong>  Additional Choices With Respect To Targeted Advertising   </strong><br><br>As described above, we and third parties may use cookies and other tracking technologies to facilitate serving relevant ads to you.
