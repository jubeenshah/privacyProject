When you share information with us, for example by creating a <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-account">Google Account</a>, we can make those services even better - to show you <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/example/more-relevant-search-results.html" >more relevant search results</a> and ads, to help you <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/example/connect-with-people.html" >connect with people</a> or to make <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/example/sharing-with-others.html" >sharing with others quicker and easier</a>.

One of the products we use to do this on our own services is Google Analytics. For example, by saving your language preferences, we'll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer.

We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction.
