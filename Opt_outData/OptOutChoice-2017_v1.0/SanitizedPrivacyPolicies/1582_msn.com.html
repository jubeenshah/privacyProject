For example, Bing uses a cookie with a unique identifier known as the Search ID to operate the service and enable certain search features. If you sign into Bing or other Microsoft services using a Microsoft account, we will set or read one or more additional cookies. We use these cookies to operate Bing and MSN services and provide you a more relevant search experience.

We use these cookies to operate Bing and MSN services and provide you a more relevant search experience. You can use your browser settings to remove or block cookies on your computer. <br><br>Please see below for more information about cookies and how to control them.<br><br>  Our Use of Cookies </strong><br><br>||| Most Microsoft web sites use "cookies," which are small text files placed on your hard disk by a web server. Cookies contain text that can be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. That text often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your computer, but may contain other information as well. Here is an example of a unique ID number stored in a cookie that Microsoft might place on your device when you visit one of our web sites: E3732CA7E319442F97EA48A170C99801 <br><br>We may use cookies for: <br><br>   Storing your Preferences and Settings.</strong> If you enter your city or postal code to get local news or weather information on a Microsoft site, we may store that city or postal code in a cookie so that you will see the relevant local information when you return to the site. This can save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information every time you visit the site.    Sign-in and Authentication.</strong> When you sign in to a site or service using your Microsoft account, we store your unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your hard disk. This cookie allows you to move from page to page at the site without having to sign in again on each page. When you sign out, these cookies are deleted from your computer. We also use cookies to improve the sign-in experience. For example, your e-mail address may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you sign out. This cookie allows your e-mail address to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in. If you are using a public computer or do not want this information to be stored, you can select the appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be used.    Targeted Advertising. </strong>When we display online advertisements to you, we will place one or more persistent cookies on your device in order to recognize your device each time we display an ad to you. Because we serve advertisements on our own web sites as well as those of our advertising and publisher partners, we are able to compile information over time about the types of pages you visit on Microsoft and other sites, content and ads you, or others who are using your computer, visited or viewed. This information is used for many purposes, for example, it helps us try to ensure that you do not see the same advertisements over and over again. We also use this information to help select and display targeted advertisements that we believe may be of interest to you. You can find more information about this use of cookies, including how to opt out of receiving targeted advertising from Microsoft, in the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwLink/?LinkId=248689">Microsoft Advertising Privacy Statement</a>.    Site Analytics. </strong>We may use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service or to develop other aggregate statistics about the operations of our sites and services. These analytics help us operate and improve the performance of these sites and services.    ||| Some of the cookies we commonly use are listed in the following chart. This list is not exhaustive, but it is intended to illustrate the reasons we typically set cookies. If you visit one of our web sites, the site may set some or all of the following cookies:<br><br> Cookie name</strong>  Description</strong><br><br> MUID Identifies unique browsers to Microsoft sites. It is used for advertising, site analytics and other operational purposes. .<br><br> ANON Contains the ANID, a unique identifier used to help identify which ads a user may like. It is also used to preserve a user's choice to opt out of behaviorally targeted ads from Microsoft, if the user has chosen to associate the opt-out with his or her Microsoft account.<br><br> CC<br><br> Contains a country code as determined by reverse IP address lookup.<br><br> Microsoft account authentication Authentication cookies (e.g., RPSTAuth, MSNRPSAuth, KievRPSAuth) used when a user signs in with a Microsoft account.<br><br> NAP<br><br> Contains an encrypted version of the user's country, Postal code, age, gender, language and occupation, if known, based on the user's Microsoft account profile.<br><br> MH<br><br> Appears on co-branded sites where Microsoft is partnering with an advertiser, this cookie identifies the advertiser so the right ad is selected.<br><br> ACH01 Maintains information about which ad and where the user clicked on the ad.<br><br> TOptOut<br><br> Indicates that the user has indicated he or she does not want to receive behaviorally targeted ads delivered by Microsoft.<br><br> ||| In addition to the cookies Microsoft may set when you visit our web sites, third parties may also set certain cookies on your device when you visit Microsoft sites. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide certain services on our behalf, such as site analytics. In other cases, it is because our web pages contain content or ads from third parties, such as videos, news content or ads delivered by other ad networks. Because your browser connects to those third parties' web servers to retrieve that content, those third parties are able to set or read their own cookies on your device and may collect information about your online activities across websites or online services.. <br><br>  How to Control Cookies </strong><br><br>|||    Browser Controls to Block Cookies.</strong> Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to block cookies.   For example, in Internet Explorer 11, you may block cookies by taking the following steps: <br><br>    Click "Tools" and then select "Internet Options"   Click the "Privacy" tab at the top of the window   Move the slider up or down to indicate the rules you want to apply for blocking cookies    Instructions for blocking cookies in other browsers are available at each browser's privacy statement.<br><br>Please be aware that if you choose to block cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of Microsoft sites and services that depend on cookies, and some advertising preferences that are dependent on cookies may not be able to be respected. <br><br>    Browser Controls to Delete Cookies</strong>. If you accept cookies, you can delete them later.   For example, in Internet Explorer 11, you may delete cookies by taking the following steps: <br><br>    Click "Tools" and then select "Internet Options"   On the "General" tab, under "Browsing History," click the "Delete" button   On the pop-up, select the box next to "Cookies"   Click the "Delete" button    Instructions for deleting cookies in other browsers are available at each browser's privacy statement. <br><br>Please be aware that if you choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, will be deleted and may need to be recreated.<br><br>   <br><br> Browser Controls for "Do Not Track" and Tracking Protection.</strong> Some newer browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Those sites may continue to engage in activities you might view as tracking even though you have expressed this preference, depending on the sites' privacy practices. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Microsoft does not currently respond to the browser DNT signals on its own websites or online services, or on third-party websites or online services where Microsoft provides advertisements, content or is otherwise able to collect information. We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat DNT signals. In the meantime, users may continue to opt-out of targeted ads from Microsoft as set forth above.<br><br>   ||| Internet Explorer (versions 9 and up) have a feature called Tracking Protection that helps prevent the web sites you go to from automatically sending details about your visit to third-party content providers. When you add a Tracking Protection List, Internet Explorer will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed as a site to be blocked. By limiting calls to these sites, Internet Explorer will limit the information these third-party sites can collect about you. For more information about Tracking Protection Lists and Do Not Track, please see the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=239590"> Internet Explorer privacy statement </a> or <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=298947"> Internet Explorer Help </a>.<br><br>|||    Advertising Opt-Out Controls.</strong> Because cookies may be used for many purposes, users who object to behaviorally targeted advertising may choose to accept cookies but opt out from that particular use at <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759" > Your privacy and Microsoft personalized ads </a>. Companies in the online advertising industry have developed guidelines and programs to help protect users' privacy, and these industry programs include web pages you can visit to opt out from receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements from all participating companies (including Microsoft). These pages include:<br><br>   Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Consumer Choice Page: <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>  Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) Opt-Out Page: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>  In Europe, you may also visit Your Online Choices: <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/">http://www.youronlinechoices.com/</a>  In Canada, for English visit <a href="http://www.youradchoices.ca/" > Ad Choices: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada </a>(DAAC) and for French visit <a href="http://www.youradchoices.ca/fr" > Choix de Pub: l'Alliance de la publicité numérique du Canada (DAAC) </a>  <br><br> |||   Individual advertising companies may also offer their own opt-out capabilities plus more advanced advertising choices. For instance, Microsoft's advertising preference and opt-out controls are available at <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759" > Your privacy and Microsoft personalized ads </a>. Please note that opting out does not mean that you will stop getting ads or see fewer ads; however, if you do opt out, the ads that you receive will no longer be behaviorally targeted. In addition, opting out does not stop information from being collected.<br><br>  Our Use of Web Beacons </strong><br><br> ||| Microsoft web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that may be used to help deliver cookies on our sites, let us count users who have visited those pages and deliver co-branded services. We may include web beacons in our promotional e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. <br><br>||| We may also work with other companies that advertise on Microsoft sites to place web beacons on their sites or in their advertisements to let us develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on a Microsoft site results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser's site.<br><br>Finally, Microsoft sites may contain web beacons from third parties to help us compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other web site operations. These web beacons may allow the third parties to set or read a cookie on your computer. These companies may collect information about your online activities across websites or online services, however, we prohibit third parties from using web beacons on our sites to collect or access your personal information. You may be able to opt out from data collection or use by these third-party analytics companies by clicking the links for each of the following analytics providers: <br><br>|||   Other Similar Technologies </strong><br><br>In addition to standard cookies and web beacons, web sites can use other technologies to store and read data files on your computer. This may be done to maintain your preferences or to improve speed and performance by storing certain files locally. But, like standard cookies, it can also be used to store a unique identifier for your computer, which can then be used to track behavior. These technologies include Local Shared Objects (or "Flash cookies") and Silverlight Application Storage. <br><br>   <br><br> Local Shared Objects or "Flash cookies."</strong> Web sites that use Adobe Flash technologies may use Local Shared Objects or "Flash cookies" to store data on your computer.

In those cases, when you sign in, Microsoft will provide your email address but not your password to the site or service. If you created your Microsoft account credentials with the site or service, it may have limited access to information associated with your credentials and profile as noted during account creation. <br><br>If you received your account from a third party, like a school, a business, an internet service provider or the administrator of a managed domain, that third party may have rights with respect to your account, including the ability to reset your password, view your account usage or profile information, read or store content in your account, and suspend or cancel your account. In these cases, you are subject to the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=397551">Microsoft Services Agreement</a> and to any additional terms of use from that third party. If you are the administrator of a managed domain and have provided your users with Microsoft accounts, you are responsible for all activity that takes place within those accounts. <br><br>Please note that sites and services that permit you to sign in with your Microsoft account can use or share your email address or other personal information that you provide to them as described in their privacy statements. They can share the unique ID number the Microsoft account service provides them only in order to fulfill a service or transaction that you may have requested. All sites or services that use the Microsoft account are required to have a posted privacy statement, but we do not control or monitor the privacy practices of those sites, and their privacy practices will vary.<br><br> ||| <strong>You should carefully review the privacy statement for each site you sign in to in order to determine how each site or service will use the information it collects. </strong><br><br><strong>Connecting your Microsoft account to your social network accounts</strong><br><br>You may connect your Microsoft account to your account on a social network such as Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn in order to access information from that social network in your Microsoft account. For example, connecting your Microsoft account to your social network account lets you see status updates or messages from people you have friended or are following on the social network in your Outlook.com inbox; include them in your Microsoft account address book; and view their birthdays in your Microsoft account calendar. If you choose to connect your Microsoft account to your account on a social network, we will cache certain information about your social network account on our servers so that we can display updated information from your social network account.<br><br> ||| You can see a list of the social networks that offer accounts to which you can connect your Microsoft account, as well as the social network accounts that you've actually connected to your Microsoft account, by signing in and going to profile.live.com/services. You can disconnect a social network account from your Microsoft account at any time at profile.live.com/services. If you disconnect a social network account, we will no longer cache information from that account.<br><br>Microsoft is not responsible for content originating from non-Microsoft services or for information you share with or send to those services.

If you or Microsoft close your Microsoft account as provided in the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=397551" >Microsoft Services Agreement</a>, that email address or username (but not the Microsoft account itself) may be recycled into our system and assigned to another user.
