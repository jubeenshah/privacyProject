This process usually completes within 72 hours but can take up to 10 days in rare situations. However, if you later register for a Zacks product again, your name will be removed from the Do Not Email list.<br><br> Please note that while Zacks will not freely distribute the information you submit, if you click to unsubscribe from mailings sent to the Zacks.com Opt-In Marketing List from a particular marketer, we are obligated to share your email address with that marketer for the purpose of being added to their Do Not Mail list. How that mailer manages your email address after that time is beyond Zacks.com control.<br><br>||| <strong> Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule:</strong> If a child has provided us with private information without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian should e-mail us to remove the information and unsubscribe the child from any promotional contact opportunities.
