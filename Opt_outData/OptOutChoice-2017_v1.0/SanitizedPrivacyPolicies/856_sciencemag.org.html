Examples may include hosting our web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These companies and individuals will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not share that information with any other third party. <br><br> ||| 3. We may disclose such information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a governmental entity, or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of AAAS; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public. <br><br>4.

There are two ways of doing this: <br><br>You can post your resume in our database as either a public or private resume. Public resumes can be searched by parties with access to our searchable resume database. <br><br> ||| If you allow your resume to be searchable, then all parties with access to our searchable resume database (or copies thereof) will have access to your resume. We attempt to limit access to our searchable resume database (or copies thereof) only to paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals as well as law enforcement and national security agencies, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. We are not responsible for the use made of resumes by third parties who access such resumes while they are in our searchable database. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. However, employers, recruiters, and others who have paid for access to that database or to obtain a copy of that database as well as parties who have otherwise gained access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes in these instances. <br><br>Please Note: It is not our practice to restrict access to our resume database to any particular customer(s). Please be advised that your current employer or an entity affiliated with your current employer might be a customer of the<br><br> ||| <strong>Science</strong>Careers.org sites. We are not responsible for any actions or results that may occur as a result of any customer's access to and/or use of your resume. <br><br>We reserve the right to remove from our database any resumes we consider to be illegal or offensive.<br><br><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/site/help/about/privacy.xhtml#ContentTop" >Back to Top</a><br><br> <strong>ADDITIONAL TERMS AND RULES FOR SOCIAL NETWORKING</strong> <br><br>Social networking services provided on the<br><br> <strong>Science</strong> Website (e.g. the<br><br> <strong>Science</strong> Careers Community pages) may have additional terms of conduct, privacy policies, and privacy settings that you will be required to agree to and set when you register for such services. <br><br>||| <strong>USE OF COOKIES</strong> <br><br>We use "cookies" to help personalize and maximize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard drive by a web page server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize pages or register for services on any of the<br><br> ||| <strong>Science</strong> websites, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information (such as user name, password, and preferences). Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more personalized site experience. When you return to the<br><br> <strong>Science</strong> Website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized. We also use cookies to track click streams and for load balancing. <br><br>You may have the ability to accept or decline all cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline all cookies if you prefer. Alternatively, you may be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. It is possible to sign in to any of the<br><br> ||| <strong>Science</strong> websites without accepting cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience at the<br><br> <strong>Science</strong> Website. <br><br><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/site/help/about/privacy.xhtml#ContentTop" >Back to Top</a><br><br> <strong>USE OF WEB BEACONS</strong> <br><br>Our web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel GIFs) that allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information on the<br><br> ||| <strong>Science</strong> Website; they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about our Website usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides. <br><br><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/site/help/about/privacy.xhtml#ContentTop" >Back to Top</a><br><br> <strong>UPDATING YOUR INFORMATION</strong> <br><br>It is important to us that we have your correct contact information so that you don't miss out on further correspondence or experience problems with the delivery of publications and products. <br><br>Members can change their personal information or update their account information at any time by linking to <a href="http://aaasmember.org/">http://aaasmember.org</a> and selecting Member Services.

In addition, all credit transactions occur in a secure area of our site, to protect you from any loss, misuse, or alteration of information collected. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. When you place an order online at any of the<br><br> <strong>Science</strong> websites, your credit card information is protected through the use of encryption utilizing Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, the industry standard in transferring information to process your orders. <br><br> ||| The SSL encrypts, or translates, your order information into a highly indecipherable code, which is processed immediately. When you've finished your transactions and begin the checkout process, you will move into the secure area of our site. A warning window may pop up to notify you that you are entering this "safe" area. Once you've entered, the page address (URL) will change from http to https, to let you know you are in a secure area. Also, a key or closed lock will appear in the lower left-hand corner of your screen to notify you of this change. You will remain in this secure zone for the entire checkout process. In addition, only the last four digits of your credit card number will be revealed on the screen when confirming an order. Of course, we securely transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card service company during order processing. <br><br><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/site/help/about/privacy.xhtml#ContentTop" >Back to Top</a><br><br> ||| <strong>CHILDREN</strong> <br><br>The<br><br> <strong>Science</strong> websites are not intended for children under 13 years of age.
