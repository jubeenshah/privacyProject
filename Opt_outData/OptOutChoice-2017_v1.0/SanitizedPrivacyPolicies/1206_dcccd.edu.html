We promise to:<br><br>   Comply with all the applicable local, state and federal laws and regulations; and    Protect your privacy while still offering relevant, personalized service.  DCCCD is a public higher education institution and therefore bound by the Texas Public Information Act and the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Continue reading for more detailed information about DCCCD's Privacy and Security Commitment. <br><br>||| <strong> Texas Public Information Act</strong> <br><br>The <a href="http://www.oag.state.tx.us/open/requestors.shtml">Texas Public Information Act</a> requires disclosure of information by a public body -- unless the law specifically protects the information. Most information kept by a public body is public under the Act. The State Attorney General enforces this Act. <br><br><a href="http://www.dcccd.edu/Pages/privacysecurity.aspx#top">Back to the top</a><br><br> <br><br> <strong>Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA)</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html" >FERPA</a> protects educational records of a student from public disclosure without written permission of the student. Although many exceptions to the Act exist, the exceptions are very limited. The Department of Education enforces this Act.<br><br>||| <strong>Directory Information</strong> <br><br>Unless you request that your information be withheld, to comply with FERPA, DCCCD may release information classified as "directory information" to the general public without the written consent of the student. Directory information includes:<br><br>   name;    home address;    home telephone number;    email addresses;    field of study;    photograph;    dates of attendance;    enrollment status, i.e., full-time, part-time, undergraduate, graduate;    degrees, certificates and other honors and awards received;    the type of award received, i.e., academic, technical, tech-prep, or continuing education;    participation in officially recognized activities;    weight and height of members of athletic teams;    student classification;    name of the most recent previous institution attended.    ||| <a href="http://www.dcccd.edu/Pages/privacysecurity.aspx#top">Back to the top</a><br><br><strong> How to request that your directory information be withheld</strong> <br><br>A student may request that the institution withhold from the public all or any part of the student's directory information. To request withholding of this information, a student shall give written notice (in person, by mail or fax) to the Registrar's Office during the first 12 class days of a Fall or Spring semester or the first four class days of a Summer session. If they are unable to provide written notice within these time frames, credit students may protect their directory information at any time during the academic year through eConnect's 'My Privacy' feature. If a request to withhold information is not made, the institution shall release all directory information. <br><br>||| Directory information is released only upon written request unless permitted by law. Telephone requests are not acceptable. Transcripts or academic records are not released without a student's written consent except as allowed by law.<br><br><a href="http://www.dcccd.edu/Pages/privacysecurity.aspx#top">Back to the top</a><br><br><strong>Information collected by DCCCD</strong> <br><br>DCCCD's Web servers only record the visitor's Internet Protocol (IP) address.<br><br>We also use Google's services (Google Analytics, Google's Display Advertising, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting) to record and review additional information about our users to improve our user experience and services. <br><br>You can review the information Google has about you in Google's Ads Settings and opt-out of the tracking at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" >https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.<br><br>||| <a href="http://www.dcccd.edu/Pages/privacysecurity.aspx#top">Back to the top</a><br><br><strong>Cookies and how they are used</strong> <br><br>We use <a href="http://www.netlingo.com/word/cookies.php" >cookies</a> to:<br><br>   Store visitors' preferences;    Record session information;    Record user-specific information on what pages visitors visit;    Customize webpage content on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends;   Show DCCCD ads to people who have previously visited our website.  <a href="http://www.dcccd.edu/Pages/privacysecurity.aspx#top">Back to the top</a><br><br>||| <strong>How to view your information</strong> <br><br>Currently enrolled (or recently enrolled) credit students who are registered at one of DCCCD's nine locations can obtain access to their personal information through eConnect, a secure web interface that requires you to enter your student identification number and a password.
